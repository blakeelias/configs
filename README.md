awesome
=========

This contains two different types of configuration files that I use with awesome: one with a laptop and one with a desktop.

###Laptop
The laptop configuration includes a modified menubar (with shutdown and restart options), an audio widget and a power widget.

###Desktop
The desktop configuration is made with dual monitors in mind. The first monitor contains the following widgets:
+ Audio widget
+ Update widget (Arch)
+ Uptime widget
+ Network widget
+ Memory widget
+ CPU widget

The second monitor contains:
+ Clock
+ Gmail widget (only present with new emails)
